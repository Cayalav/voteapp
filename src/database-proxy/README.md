a connection using the Mongo protocol (`mongodb://`) usually over port
`27017`.

### POST /vote

This endpoint is used to cast a vote.

#### Request Body

`application/json`

##### Schema

* `vote` - `string`; currently restricted to either "a" or "b"

##### Example

{
  "vote": "a"
}
```

### GET /results

This endpoint is used to query vote results.

#### Response

* `success` - `boolean`

* `result` - `object`; present only if success. The object has a property named for each vote ("a", "b"); the value of the property is a `number` corresponding to the number of votes cast.

## Testing

The easiest way is to test using Docker Compose.

### Testing with Docker Compose

The following will build an image for running the tests under `test/test.js` and then start
the environment declared in `./docker-compose.test.yml`.

    $ docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.test.yml run sut

If you make changes to any of the Node.js sources, rebuild the test image with the
following command:

    $ docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.test.yml build

To view logs, run:

    $ docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.test.yml logs

When finished with tests, run:

    $ docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.test.yml down
